                <h2>Laser</h2>
				               <p>Laser Dentistry is a less invasive, more comfortable option to conventional dentistry. Healthy tooth structure is preserved with the use of laser due to its pin point accuracy. Over time, this means your teeth have a longer life span because the more natural tooth structure that is present, the stronger the tooth is.
The laser produces a wavelength of energy that can cut tooth and soft tissue in most cases without local anaesthesia; however in very deep areas of the tooth where individual needs dictate, anaesthetic may be desirable. The laser is used extensively for soft tissue surgery and implant surgery reducing healing time. The laser is ideal for caries removal and tooth preparation as these procedures are carried out quickly, safely and precisely. The laser also sterilises the working area.
The laser cannot be used to remove old existing amalgams (silver fillings) as it vaporises the mercury.
The practice has five different lasers on offer. Laser is a more comfortable and conservative option to the conventional drill. Each laser has specific applications which cover the following:
<ul>
<li>Laser teeth whitening (Smartbleach)</li>
<li>Laser for soft tissue surgery and painful jaw joints. This laser can also help cold sores</li>
<li>Restorative (fillings)</li>
<li>Laser Fluoride Application (preventive treatment â€“ 6 x more effective with laser)</li>
<li>Endodontic (Root Canal Treatment)</li>
<li>Diagnostic (for the early detection and treatment of decay)</li>
<li>The laser techniques are available for most procedures but will need to be individually assessed.</li>

										<p>
This includes extractions of teeth, wisdom tooth extractions, treatment of jaw fractures, removal of any pathology associated with tooth, sinus lift surgeries, biopsies and pre prosthetic surgeries.
<h3>Tooth Removal</h3><br>
Sometimes, even after taking all the efforts, tooth disease can reach a stage where the teeth are not salvageable. In such cases, we may need a dental extraction to prevent further damage to the underlying bone and surrounding gums and teeth.<br>
Traditional extractions are done by expanding and fracturing the plate of bone on the cheek side. This is very precious bone. Once lost, it is exceedingly hard to regain. It also, more often than not, impairs our ability to restore the lost tooth by a dental implant. And that's where PERFECT SMILE  specializes in keeping any extraction as minimally invasive and traumatic as possible<br>
With the technologies available at PERFECT SMILE, it is very rare that we extract an important functional tooth or any tooth in the aesthetic zone. Our major dental extraction procedures involve the removal of third molars (wisdom teeth / molar extraction) and dental extractions for orthodontic purposes that give functional and cosmetic improvement.<br>
<h3>Wisdom teeth extractions (Third molar surgeries)</h3>
When there is no sufficient space to erupt in the oral cavity (impacted wisdom teeth) removal of wisdom teeth is suggested for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>	They are prone to tooth decay and infection</li>
<li>	They may cause severe gum disease which may affect the supporting tissues and bone structures of the surrounding teeth.</li>
<li>	To prevent unwanted movement of teeth after an orthodontic treatment.</li>
</ul>
Your wisdom tooth removal treatment may either be "simple" or "surgical". Simple wisdom tooth removal surgery is performed on teeth that are visible in the mouth under local anesthesia, and require only the use of instruments to elevate and/or grasp the visible portion of the tooth. Typically, the tooth is lifted and rocked back and forth to make the tooth loose enough to be removed. Surgical wisdom tooth treatments involve the removal of wisdom teeth that cannot be easily accessed, usually because they are covered by the gums partially or completely.

                                        <h2>Orthodontics</h2>
										<p>Dental braces (also known as orthodontic braces, or braces) are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help to position them with regard to a person's bite, while also working to improve dental health. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, overbites, cross bites, open bites, deep bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. 

Lingual braces are custom made fixed braces bonded to the back of the teeth making them invisible to other people. In lingual braces the brackets are cemented onto the backside of the teeth making them invisible while in standard braces the brackets are cemented onto the front side of the teeth. Hence, lingual braces are a cosmetic alternative to those who do not wish the braces to be visible.

Aligners
Aligners are removable medical grade plastic appliances which patient wears instead of brackets and wires to correct malocclusion. Dental aligners are a modern alternative to braces, for teeth that are in need of straightening. 
A Clear change to the concept of Cosmetic and Adult Orthodontic treatment without using conventional methods of wires and brackets. Adults wouldn't have asked for a better choice to correct their malocclusion without social inhibitions. </p>

<h2>Crowns</h2>
A dental crown is a tooth-shaped structure and placed over a tooth to cover it & restore its shape, size, strength, and improve its appearance enhancing the smile. A Crown is an efficient option if you have broken, discolored teeth and can be used to cover dental fillings (inlays) and dental implants. A crown is also mandatory after the root canal treatment.

It is an utmost preferred treatment to secure the natural teeth against conditions like deep dental decay, fractured teeth, discolored tooth following trauma, tooth associated with periapical pathology.
Modern Root Canal Treatment is painless & relieves tooth ache effectively in addition to saving the natural tooth. Time required is approximately 30-45 minutes for the procedure.
Deep decay if not treated, generally progresses in destroying a vital portion of teeth before it reaches the pulp of the tooth. The soft tissue which has its presence in tooth canals is known as the pulp of the tooth consisting mainly of nerves & blood vessels. On reaching the pulp, this infection results into a common dental pain. At this stage one and only way to save the tooth is to perform a root canal treatment. Root canal is a completely pain free procedure and is done under local anesthesia.
